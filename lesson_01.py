        'list': "A list is an ordered collection of items that can be changed (mutable). Lists can hold a mix of different data types like numbers, strings, or even other lists. Items are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.",
        'tuple': "A tuple is similar to a list but is immutable, meaning once it is created, it cannot be modified. Tuples are useful when you want to store a fixed collection of items, like the coordinates of a point (x, y).",

# Teach float

# Teach string

# Teach boolean
teach_type("Boolean (bool)", bool, [

# Teach list

    "Lists can hold different data types in one collection.",

# Teach tuple

# Teach dictionary

# Teach set
